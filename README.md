# ColorMixer - useReducer Example

This is a single page application developed to practice useReducer hook.
With this app user can change RGB values and see the result as a color immediately.

There are two options to update the RGB value :

1)TextInput : you can set any value between 0-255 , the Input accepts only these interval as expected.

2)Increase and decrease buttons : updates RGB values by increasing or decreasing by 15, these buttons also works only with 0-255 interval.

With the copy button which exists on the bottom of the page user can copy the RGB value as rgb(number,number,number) format for sharing purposes.
